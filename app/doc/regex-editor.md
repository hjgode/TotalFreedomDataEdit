Here you view all rules and re-order, edit them. The activity also allows to add a new rule.

## Note

Tap on [SAVE LIST] to save the current list or changes are lost.

To edit, delete or move a rule, tap on a rule in the list and use the desired item in the popup menu.

Rule changes for existing or new rules are done in the Edit Rule screen.

There are two options to make the rule global or a no-stop-rule.

The AimID can either be selected from a list or typed in manually.

If the 'Search for' (the regex) starts with a '#' symbol, the rule will be treated as a comment.

Tapping on one of the small texts on the bottom of the screen inserts pre-defined, commonly used Regex sequences at the current text cursor position (carret).

Finally tap on [Save] to save the new or changed rule. Tapping the [CANCEL] button will discard the changes.

To save the changed rules list, tap on [SAVE LIST] to save the changes to the rules file.
